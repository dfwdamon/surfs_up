### Key Differences 
There were a few differences in the weather data for these two months.

- The average temperatures are very similar and only 4 degrees apart.  This trend is even less by 3 degrees for the 75th percentile! 

- The lowest temps in the 25th percentile are 4 degrees apart.  While the hightest temperatures in the 25th percentile are only 2 degrees apart. 

- Overall, temperatures are very similar for each monthly period, with limited fluctation.

## Summary
Overall, the temperatures in this region of Hawaii are quite temperate which is partly a reason for the high rate of tourism in the state. It is recommended that two additional  data points be included in an assessment to better characterize the overall weather conditions to ensure the most preferential months are identified. The first would be rainfall data during these months, and the second could be tourism activity. Low rainfall periods are preferred for outdoor activities and together with high season periods of toursists, means higher revenue periods. Once the data is obtained and fully assessed, a solid recommendation can be produced. In the mean time - Hang Loose!
