It is recommended that two additional data points be included to better characterize the overall weather conditions to ensure the most preferential months are identified. The first point is rainfall data during the period, and tourism activity by location. Low rainfall periods are preferred for outdoor activities and together with high season periods of toursists, results in opportunity for higher revenue periods.
